# sinatra-project

Welcome to the Pokemon Sinatra Project.

For this project I used HTML, CSS, Ruby, and ActiveRecord and Sinatra.
There are also various pieces of Javascript used in certain portions of the project to provide on-click functionality for some objects.


Start:
To start, begin by signing up.  
You will need to choose a name, a unique username, and a password.
If your username is taken by another user, you will be directed back to the sign-in screen with a
red message indicating the username is already chosen.

You will also need to choose a photo from the selection provide.


User's homepage
You will be brought to your unique homepage where you will see your picture
and your bio.  Initially your bio will be empty, you will need to edit bio to update it.

You may also choose to catch a new pokemon to add to your inventory.

You may rename the pokemon or release it if you feel the it is better off in the wild.
